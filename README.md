### Project Goals

The challenge entailed creating a calculator application containing all the basic math operations found in a calculator, e.g addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Check this [link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) for more details on what should be done.

### Extra Credit

The task included adding floating point numbers, backspace button, keyboard support and making the app look nice.

### Completion

I started the project in late May and I'm fairly happy with where it is now. Will be coming back to add some functionalities that are not responding well.

This is the last project of the Odins foundation course.
